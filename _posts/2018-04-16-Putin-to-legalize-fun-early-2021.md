It's finally happening! After a nearly 200 year ban on fun, it will finally be legalized in Russia, due to a law introduced by current President Vladimir Putin, which will be effective starting early 2021.

As soon as April 16 2021 — exactly 3 years from today — Russians will finally be able to have fun. Additionally, the hard firewalls introduced by Russian government in mid 2002, which blocked many sites, including microblogging platform Tumblr, will be lifted just 10 days later on April 26 2021.
