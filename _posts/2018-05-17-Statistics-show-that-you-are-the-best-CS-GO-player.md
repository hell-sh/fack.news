A new study from the Steam Research Group shows that you are the best Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player. However, the game is actively matching you with the worst possible team mates, to make sure you don't win every game. This information was released just yesterday, May 16, and it has already caused quite a lot of outcry in all social media.

For example, some big gaming Youtubers have tweeted about the issue. One of them being "TED Talks," who wrote:

> I knew it; The game was matching me with bad mates on purpose!

And another gamer — "Vsauce" — tweeted

> WTF, @steam_games, do you want to be matched with my fists?!

Indicating that the lead singer of Vsauce, Steve, might want to **fight** Steam over this.

Either way, a lot of concern was raised and it's not quite clear yet how exactly they found out that you are the best Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player without ever matching you with good players in the first place.
